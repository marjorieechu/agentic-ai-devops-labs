# CI/CD Pipeline Skills

## Project Reference
- Repository: [titanic-devops-assessment](https://github.com/marjorieechu/titanic-devops-assessment)
- Reusable Workflows: [shared-gh-workflows](https://github.com/marjorieechu/shared-gh-workflows)

## Skills Demonstrated

### GitHub Actions

| Skill | Why It Matters |
|-------|---------------|
| Reusable workflows | DRY principle - centralized security policies |
| Parallel job execution | Faster feedback - scans run simultaneously |
| Job dependencies with `needs` | Ensures correct execution order |
| GitHub Environments | Separate configs for dev/staging/prod |
| Manual approval gates | Production safety - human review required |

### Shift-Left Security (Sequential Gates)

| Stage | Tool | Fails If | Why Sequential |
|-------|------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Gitleaks | Secrets found | Stop immediately - no point continuing with leaked creds |
| 2 | Checkov | IaC misconfigs | Don't build insecure infrastructure |
| 3 | SonarCloud | Quality gate failed | Don't build code with bugs/vulnerabilities |
| 4 | Tests | Coverage < 70% | Enforce code coverage standards |
| 5 | Build | - | Only after all checks pass |
| 6 | Trivy | CRITICAL/HIGH CVEs | Scan the actual built image |

**Why Sequential (not parallel)?**
- Each gate must pass before proceeding
- Fail fast - don't waste compute on doomed builds
- Clear accountability - know exactly which check failed

### Docker in CI/CD

| Skill | Why It Matters |
|-------|---------------|
| Multi-stage builds in CI | Consistent builds across environments |
| Docker layer caching (`type=gha`) | 50-80% faster builds |
| GHCR (GitHub Container Registry) | Free, integrated with GitHub Actions |
| Semantic versioning tags | Track deployments, easy rollbacks |

### Deployment Strategies

| Strategy | Implementation | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| Multi-environment | dev → staging → prod | Test changes progressively |
| Auto-deploy dev/staging | On push to branch | Fast iteration |
| Manual approval for prod | GitHub Environments | Human verification |
| Rollback capability | SHA-tagged images | Quick recovery |

### Automated Rollback

```yaml
# Store current revision before deploy
CURRENT_REVISION=$(kubectl rollout history deployment/app | tail -2 | head -1)

# Deploy and health check
kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/prod
kubectl rollout status deployment/app --timeout=300s

# If health check fails, rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/app --to-revision=$CURRENT_REVISION
```

**Why Automated Rollback?**
- Reduces MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)
- No manual intervention needed at 3am
- Health checks catch issues probes might miss

### SonarCloud Quality Gate

| Condition | Threshold | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Coverage | >= 70% | Ensure adequate test coverage |
| Duplicated Lines | <= 3% | Reduce technical debt |
| Maintainability Rating | A | Keep code maintainable |
| Reliability Rating | A | No bugs in production |
| Security Rating | A | No vulnerabilities |

## Key Files
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Main pipeline
- `shared-gh-workflows/.github/workflows/` - Reusable security scans

## Secrets Management

| Secret | Source | Never Do |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Auto-provided | Hardcode tokens |
| `SONAR_TOKEN` | GitHub Secrets | Commit to repo |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | GitHub Secrets | Log secrets |

## Commands Learned
```bash
# Trigger workflow manually
gh workflow run ci-cd.yml

# View workflow runs
gh run list

# View specific run logs
gh run view <run-id> --log
```
